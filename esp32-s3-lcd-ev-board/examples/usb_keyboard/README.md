# USB Keyboard

A USB keyboard GUI example on ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board.

## How to use example

### Configurations

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and go to `Board Support Package`:

* `BSP_LCD_SUB_BOARD`: Choose a LCD sub-board according to hardware

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

Run the example, you will see a GUI of USB keyboard. The board includes most common keys like "F1-F12", "0-9", "a-z" and so on. When press key "a", pc will input key "a" just like from a real keyboard.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure
    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.
    * Error message with `A fatal error occurred: Could not open /dev/ttyACM0, the port doesn't exist`: Please first make sure development board connected, then make board into "Download Boot" mode to upload by following steps:
        1. keep press "BOOT(SW2)" button
        2. short press "RST(SW1)" button
        3. release "BOOT(SW2)".
        4. upload program and reset
* PC can't get key from development board
    * Make sure development board connected with USB port instead of UART port.
